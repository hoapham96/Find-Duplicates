# Find-Duplicates
Using an object & key-value pairs

In JavaScript, an object consists of key-value pairs where keys are similar to indexes in an array and are unique.
If one tries to add a duplicate key with a different value, then the previous value for that key is overwritten by the new value. 
We use this concept to compare the and find the duplicates.
